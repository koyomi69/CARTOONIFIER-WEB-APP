A bilateral filter is used for smoothening images and reducing noise, while preserving edges, because a bilateral filter smooths flat regions while keeping edges sharp, it is ideally suited to convert an RGB image into a cartoon. Unfortunately, bilateral filters are orders of magnitudes slower than other smoothing operators (e.g., Gaussian blur). Thus, if speed is important, it might be a good idea to operate on a down-scaled version of the original image first and then upscale it afterwards."
